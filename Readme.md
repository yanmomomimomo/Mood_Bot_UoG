# About Emotion Detection

FaceEmotion_v0 is the very initial trying to have a try about face detection and emotion classification. Although he programming platform was MacOS. But helped with understanding programming in c++ together with CMAKE.

FaceEmotion_sciCamera  is the next version, trying to use more open-sourced libraries, including [libcamera2opencv](https://github.com/berndporr/libcamera2opencv). It is built on the foundation of an [open-source project](https://blog.csdn.net/guyuealian/article/details/129467023). (Note that there is a spelling mistake in the folder name, due to a bad and massive libs management, it would be hard to fix that, so this method was abandoned, but it did lead to the discover of a wired bug) . The example “qtviewer” provided within the libcamera2opencv seems to be incompatible with Logitech C270 USB Camera.
